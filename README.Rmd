Thee `mtree` package provides a simple implementation of *mutation trees* in cancer.

Mutation trees can be built from binary data reporting the presence or absence of specific mutations - or any other somatic covariates -  across a number of tumour regions. In this `mtree`, we integrate [Chow-Liu trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow%E2%80%93Liu_tree) with [probabilistic causation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-probabilistic/).

This type of models can be used to study the evolutionary trajectories of a tumour from bulk sequencing data, especially in setups where only targeted sequencing panels are available and methods for subclonal deconvolution cannot be used.


* `mtree` provides an S3-based implementation of mutation trees, as well as a Monte Carlo sampler that has been discussed in [Caravagna et al; PMID: 30171232](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30171232). The package provides also functions to plot and analyze the trees.

* The sibling of a mutation tree is a *clone tree*,  which is obtained from subclonal deconvolution of bulk samples when whole-genome/ exome sequencing is available; clone trees are implemented in the [ctree package](https://caravagn.github.io/ctree).

*  `mtree` is part of the `evoverse`, a [set of R packages](https://caravagn.github.io/evoverse) to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
