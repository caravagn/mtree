#' Construct a `mtree` mutation tree with known structure.
#'
#' @description 
#'
#' This constructor creates an object of class `'mtree'`, which represents a mutation tree. 
#' The tree is created from a set of binary clusters computed for a patient, here a cluster
#' is defined as the set of alterations (e.g., mutations) that are detected as present or
#' absent in the same set of sequenced biopsies.
#' 
#' To create a tree a list of drivers can be provided to be annotated to an input 
#' set of binary clusters. There are a minimum amount of information and formatting
#' fields that are required for tree construction to operate successfully. Please
#' refer to the package vignette and the provided input datasets for more instructions.
#' 
#' @seealso This function requires the input tree to be specified in the
#' format of an adjacency matrix; plese see function \code{\link{mtrees}} if you
#' need to create de novo also the adjacency matrices that fit your data.
#' 
#' @param binary_clusters Clusters of Cancer Cell Fractions available in the data of
#' this patient. See the package vignette to see the format in which this should
#' be specified.
#' @param drivers A list of driver events that should be annotated to each one
#' of the input clusters contained in the `CCF_clusters` parameter. See the package 
#' vignette to see the format in which this should be specified.
#' @param samples A vector of samples names (e.g., the biopsies sequenced for
#' this patient).
#' @param patient A string id that represent this patient. 
#' @param M The adjacency matrix defined to connect all the nodes of this tree.
#' @param score A scalar score that can be associated to this tree.
#' @param annotation Any string annotation that one wants to add to this `ctree`.
#' This will be used by some of the plotting functions that display `ctree` objects.
#' @param evaluation How Suppes conditions should be evaluated (`>=` or `>`).
#'
#' @return An object of class \code{"mtree"} that represents this tree.
