Title: mtree - Mutation Tree
Type: Package
Author: Giulio Caravagna
Maintainer: Giulio Caravagna <gcaravagn@gmail.com>
Description: This package implements mutation trees
  that can be built from multi-region binary data of cancer somatic mutations, 
  copy number alterations, etc. This type of models can be used to study
  the evolutionary trajectories of a tumour from targeted bulk sequencing data,
  or from any multi-sample data that cannot be used for the computation of
  higher-resolution models like clone trees.
  This package provides several functions to generate,  plot and summarise 
  mutation trees, and is part of the `evoverse`,a package that gathers multiple R
  packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
