\title{Plot the information transfer of a tree (drivers ordering).}
\usage{
plot_information_transfer(x,
  node_palette = colorRampPalette(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = 9,
  "Set1")), tree_layout = "tree", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ctree} tree.}

\item{node_palette}{A function that can return, for an input number,
a number of colours.}

\item{tree_layout}{Layout of this model, as of \code{ggraph}.}

\item{...}{Other parameters, not used in this case.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object for the plot.
}
\description{
The information transfer of the tree is the set of orderings
associated to the internal annotated driver events.

This function plots these orderings following a topological
sort of the node of the corresponding clone tree.
